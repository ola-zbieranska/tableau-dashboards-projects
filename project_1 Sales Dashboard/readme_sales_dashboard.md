### Sales Dashboard

This report tracks sales performance, analyzes customer behavior, and manages inventory and products. It consists of several views that include key metrics such as total revenue, the number of products sold (SKU), return rate, and customer count. The report also allows for performance analysis at the state, city, product, and category levels.<br>

Users can filter data based on various criteria, such as product category, region, product group, and shipping mode. Thanks to its interactive features, the report enables more detailed data exploration, the identification of valuable customers, and the evaluation of the best-selling products.<br>
